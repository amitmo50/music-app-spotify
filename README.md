Spotify Music App Clone Project

App url: https://music-app-spotify.netlify.app/

On this project I've used React.js and Redux as a state management.
Created the Backend Api authentication so the user can login to his account on spotify.

The app fetch the user's Playlists, Most recent songs of 2021 and a recomanded songs from a global Playlist from spotify.
you can select the songs as Favorite and this will take them to a separate playlist "Favorites".
